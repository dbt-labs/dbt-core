      # N.B.: Mypy is... a bit fragile.
      #
      # By using `language: system` we run this hook in the local
      # environment instead of a pre-commit isolated one.  This is needed
      # to ensure mypy correctly parses the project.
      #
      # It may cause trouble
      # in that it adds environmental variables out of our control to the
      # mix.  Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about per pre-commit's
      # author.
      # See https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/730 for details.
